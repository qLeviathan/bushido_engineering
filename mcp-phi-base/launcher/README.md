```

Or make it executable:

chmod +x launcher.py
./launcher.py
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- tkinter (usually included with Python)
- Docker must be installed and running
- Node.js and npm for web interface

## Troubleshooting

### "No module named tkinter"
- **Linux**: `sudo apt-get install python3-tk`
- **macOS**: tkinter comes with Python from python.org
- **Windows**: Reinstall Python and check "tcl/tk" option

### Docker commands fail
- Ensure Docker Desktop is running
- Check user has permission to run Docker
- On Linux: `sudo usermod -aG docker $USER`

### System won't start
- Check if ports are already in use
- Verify all dependencies are installed
- Check Docker has enough resources allocated

## Customization

### Change Colors
Edit the color scheme in `launcher.py`:
```python
self.bg_color = "#0a192f"       # Background
self.accent_color = "#FFD700"   # Golden accent
self.success_color = "#64ffda"  # Success green
```

### Add Custom Actions
Add new buttons in the `create_widgets()` method.

## Development

The launcher is a standalone Python/tkinter application that:
1. Manages Docker services via subprocess
2. Monitors system status
3. Provides quick access to all features
4. Shows real-time logs and status

No external dependencies required beyond standard library!

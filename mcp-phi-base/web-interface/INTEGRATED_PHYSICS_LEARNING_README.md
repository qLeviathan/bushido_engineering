# Integrated Physics Learning Platform

## Overview

The φ-Discovery Integrated Physics Learning Platform combines interactive equation mind maps with AI-powered assistance to create a comprehensive physics education environment. The system features real-time topological analysis, visual Betti number explanations, and context-aware AI support through Claude.

## Key Features

### 1. **Dual-View Interface**
- **Main Discovery Interface** (`index.html`)
  - Embedded mind map toggle for quick equation exploration
  - Real-time MCP/Claude integration
  - In-context equation selection with visual Betti numbers
  
- **Dedicated Learning Platform** (`integrated-physics-learning.html`)
  - Full-screen mind map with physics domains
  - Split-view with AI assistant
  - Three modes: Explore, Learn, and Solve

### 2. **AI Context Awareness**
When you click on an equation, the system:
- Sends equation context to Claude via WebSocket
- Includes topological properties (Betti numbers)
- Provides domain-specific information
- Enables contextual Q&A about the selected equation

### 3. **Visual Betti Number Explanations**

#### B₀ (Connected Components)
- Visual: Separate circles representing disconnected pieces
- Example: `F = ma` has B₀=1 (single connected equation)
- Physics meaning: Number of independent systems or concepts

#### B₁ (Cycles/Holes)
- Visual: Rings with hollow centers
- Example: `E = hf` has B₁=1 (wave-particle duality cycle)
- Physics meaning: Feedback loops, conservation laws, or dualities

#### B₂ (Voids/Cavities)
- Visual: 3D sphere with internal cavity
- Example: `E = mc²` has B₂=1 (mass-energy unity void)
- Physics meaning: Fundamental unifications or enclosed symmetries

### 4. **Educational Modes**

#### Explore Mode
- Free navigation of equation relationships
- Hover for quick information
- Click for detailed analysis

#### Learn Mode
- Guided learning paths
- Step-by-step derivations
- Connected concept exploration

#### Solve Mode
- Problem-solving workspace
- Step-by-step solution guidance
- Real-world application examples

### WebSocket Communication

The system uses WebSocket for real-time communication:

```javascript
// Equation selection sends context
{
    type: 'equation_selected',
    equation: 'E = mc²',
    betti: [1, 0, 1],
    archetype: 'relativity'
}

// AI receives context for responses
{
    type: 'chat_message',
    message: 'Explain this equation',
    context: { equation, data },
    mode: 'learn'
}
```

### Visual Components

The Betti visualizer (`betti-visual-component.js`) provides:
- Animated representations of topological features
- Interactive hover states
- Responsive canvas rendering
- Equation-specific visualizations

## Educational Philosophy

This platform embodies the principle that mathematical topology reveals deep physics insights. By visualizing Betti numbers, students can:
- See the structural "shape" of equations
- Understand fundamental connections
- Develop intuition for mathematical physics
- Bridge abstract math with physical reality

The AI assistant provides personalized guidance while maintaining focus on conceptual understanding rather than mere calculation.
